Has a lot of potential going forward (for content curation) if we combine it other technologies such as pattern searching and machine learning.\n- Some positive side effects. One less repo to manage. Impala/Computer_Vision was merged into pixalytics. I feel better about getting to refactor distillery. Its not one huge file anymore.\n- I loved working alongside other people. In this case, Dennis and Melody.\n\nCons\n------\n- Google's technology isn't great yet. And it holds us back sometimes.\n- I wish I realized earlier that the deployment process is going to be so much more complicated than I predicted.\n- Deployment process took like 3 times the time I predicted and that had a chain effect in slowing down other processes like QA and improvements. I could have used that time to work on other things such as frequencies.\n- I do regret not getting the frequencies working within the time period.\n\n\n\nPersonal\n=======\n\nPros\n-----\n- I wanted to work on something backend oriented and I got my wish.\n- I wanted a chance to be involved with Elasticsearch and I got my wish.\n- A challenging deployment process meant more learning opportunity.\n\nCons\n------\n- I realized that CV wasn't something that was going to make a significant impact.

- Why do we want to use Google Analytics for tracking time spent? We want to report the website engagement metrics in CP right?\n\nQ2 - Is the argument that we're trying to make - Time spent on pages that have Pixlee widgets is more than pages which do not.\n\nQ3 - The biggest questions are - is this going to exist only for people who eCommerce integrations (and allow us to put JS on their page)? or everybody? Because calculating this kind of data will require us to record data from all pages and not just the pages which have our widgets. Are we willing to make a significant change from our current flow to -> Include the following code in all of your pages? (like Segment)\n\nWho are the other people who are doing this other than Google Analytics \n- Clicktale (have an API, but not publicly exposed)\n- Mouseflow (have a nice API)\n- Extrawatch\n\nOtherwise, if we can put our JS on the customer's pages. Rolling out something on our own isn't too hard actually.\n\n- User activity can be tracked pretty accurately using distinct_user_hash and JS events like mousemove, scroll, keyup, keydown and click etc\n- Bounces can be tracked using beforeunload\n\n**Our Own**\nArguments for our own\n- Mouseflow and other APIs are expensive. And we don't really need most of the stuff they do like heatmapes etc.\n- Google Analytics API is unintitive and we'll need to setup ETL.\n\n1. Sessions [Total Time Spent, Time spent per page]\n2. Multiple sessions per distinct_user_hash gives us repeated visits.\n3.

Improvements**\n- Naming conventions - `display_options_id` vs. `display_option_id`.\n- More Documentation on edge cases and related behavior.\n- More Rainforest QA tests and using them on beta for development purposes as well.\n- We better do `1` and `2` early rather than late since our codebase is growing at a rapid rate.\n\n**Things we did well**\n- Early meeting with Melody helped a lot in me understanding the value and scope.\n- Early meeting with Jeff helped a lot in me getting a good start.\n- Happy about the fact that I was on time. We predicted 23rd September. Photos were pushed on 21st September and CP on 26th.\n- Jeff was able to find bugs that I couldn't and overall it made me comfortable that it minimized the risk of me pushing bad code and breaking widgets.\n\n**Things we could've done better**\n- Clearer communication on what \"only backend\" meant as per my understanding vs. Melody and Dennis. Maybe an expectation doc would've helped.\n- Should've written Rainforest QA tests early (taken Dennis's advice lol) and used them to reduce my QA work.\n\n**Personal Pros**\n- Got to work on sensitive code and I liked the challenge\n- On an emotional level, I like that it was discussed and given minutes on All-Hands multiple times. I love it when I know that I'm working on important stuff.\n\n**Personal Cons**\n- Involved a lot of manual QA and things like fixing one thing leading to break another became frustrating really quickly.\n- The biggest challenges involved in QA and thinking about edge cases (We were on staging after 5 days - 11 September). Did not feel very challenged on a problem-solving or extensive thinking level.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"56faceeb3725d51fffc9bf91","idList":"57b9e0f6fdcca4f4790c52cf","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":67,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":[],"name":"Retro Notes","pos":8191.9375,"shortLink":"vr7WpQ8r","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"satnamdhanoa+2hz7a3jg92nrfajkl8z+2mutyjego8oyxrjg983+227zuinx8h@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["534c7a8ac33525852751b393"],"labels":[],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/vr7WpQ8r","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/vr7WpQ8r/67-retro-notes","attachments":[],"pluginData":[]},{"id":"57eb764d31989e546bdf516c","checkItemStates":null,"closed":true,"dateLastActivity":"2016-10-01T12:56:34.654Z","desc":"","descData":null,"idBoard":"56faceeb3725d51fffc9bf91","idList":"57b9e0f6fdcca4f4790c52cf","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":103,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":[],"name":"Q3 Survey","pos":12287.90625,"shortLink":"Z0iaxGbV","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":false,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"satnamdhanoa+2hz7a3jg92nrfajkl8z+2mywc22v83asjq4ntkc+2k16l5bcx6@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/Z0iaxGbV","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/Z0iaxGbV/103-q3-survey","attachments":[],"pluginData":[]},{"id":"57ec443d985abcf2f3e86b4d","checkItemStates":null,"closed":true,"dateLastActivity":"2016-09-29T23:29:35.592Z","desc":"**Why Pinterest is good**\n\n- Pinterest has more than 100m active users. Most of them in USA. [Source](http://venturebeat.com/2015/09/18/with-100m-users-pinterests-promoted-pins-just-became-a-lot-more-attractive-to-advertisers/). Where as only 20% of the active Instagram users are from USA. [Source](https://www.statista.com/topics/1882/instagram/).\n- Pinterest's engagement rate has been increasing whereas Instagram's declined by 40% last year. [Source](http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/15/instagram-interaction-rates-dropped-40-last-year-and-other-bad-news-report/).\n\n- Automated, daily pins/posts for top performing UGC content. Daily featured post. Help build a more authentic relation between our customer and its customers. If customers are relying on their customers for \"word or mouth\", customers should be more proactive about rewarding and recognizing those customers.\n- Customers with a large user base can't recognize all of their users by posting their content because number of posts per day after a certain threshold. A liking, favorite or retweeting their content is still a valid option.\n- Monitor who saves those pins. Target those users using Pinterest Ads Manager. If we can become a Marketing Developer Partner for Pinterest, we can even automate that using their API.\n- Prove value using stats such as users visiting their website using our links vs. other users.\n\n## Targeted UGC Ads\n\n**Idea**\nFind Instagram and Pinterest users who are likely to buy from our customers. And target them with ads on behalf of our customers. How do we find those users? There are degrees - \n1. Who like customer's content.\n2. Who like relevant and famous UGC Content.\n3. Who like relevant and less famous UGC Content.\n\nWhy?\nIts a proven fact that social media advertising (61%) is more effective than traditional online promotion (39%). [[Source]](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/new-research-reveals-paid-social-media-effectiveness/). Kayla mentioned that for her there was a direct correlation on how much she spent on ads and performance of her store. She found it easy to do, and less time consuming. Other store owners probably think very highly of targeted social media ads and we should make it even easier for them.\n\n**Can Instagram ads be targeted to specific users?**\nYes. Instagram offers same ads targeting options as Facebook. [[Source]](https://m.facebook.com/business/help/953919194659289). And Facebook allows advertisers to create a custom audience and target using user handles, phone numbers and/or email address. [[Source]](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/433385333434831)\n\n**Does Instagram API expose people like specific content?**\n- Yes.
